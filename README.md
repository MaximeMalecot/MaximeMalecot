## Welcome to my profile

I'm MaximeMalecot, a student at ESGI Paris soon graduating. 
Some knowledges about me :
- Most of my repositories are school projects
- I work part-time for Crit France, as a Fullstack developper
- I try to learn as much as possible in infrastructure deployment, and architecturation's best practices
- I prefer back-end to front-end even if I'm fullstack.
